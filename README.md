# Vagrant ToroDB
> Vagrant project to create a base system to use with ToroDB

ToroDB has some requirements and it is a pain in the ass to create a virtual machine each time to do that, with this Vagrant recipe you have a base machine with requirements installed.

* Oracle Java 8
* MongoDB 3.2
* PostgreSQL 9.5

## Usage

If you have Vagrant installed in your system, just run it from the root path of the project.

```
$ vagrant up
```
